By itself, the law of conservation of momentum is not enough to determine the motion of particles after a collision. Another property of the motion, kinetic energy, must be known. This is not necessarily conserved. If it is conserved, the collision is called an elastic collision; if not, it is an inelastic collision.

Elastic collisions
Main article: Elastic collision

Elastic collision of equal masses

Elastic collision of unequal masses
An elastic collision is one in which no kinetic energy is absorbed in the collision. Perfectly elastic "collisions" can occur when the objects do not touch each other, as for example in atomic or nuclear scattering where electric repulsion keeps them apart. A slingshot maneuver of a satellite around a planet can also be viewed as a perfectly elastic collision. A collision between two pool balls is a good example of an almost totally elastic collision, due to their high rigidity, but when bodies come in contact there is always some dissipation.[8]

A head-on elastic collision between two bodies can be represented by velocities in one dimension, along a line passing through the bodies. If the velocities are u1 and u2 before the collision and v1 and v2 after, the equations expressing conservation of momentum and kinetic energy are:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}m_{1}u_{1}+m_{2}u_{2}&=m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}\\{\tfrac {1}{2}}m_{1}u_{1}^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}m_{2}u_{2}^{2}&={\tfrac {1}{2}}m_{1}v_{1}^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}m_{2}v_{2}^{2}\,.\end{aligned}}} {\begin{aligned}m_{1}u_{1}+m_{2}u_{2}&=m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}\\{\tfrac {1}{2}}m_{1}u_{1}^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}m_{2}u_{2}^{2}&={\tfrac {1}{2}}m_{1}v_{1}^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}m_{2}v_{2}^{2}\,.\end{aligned}}
A change of reference frame can simplify analysis of a collision. For example, suppose there are two bodies of equal mass m, one stationary and one approaching the other at a speed v (as in the figure). The center of mass is moving at speed 
v
/
2
 and both bodies are moving towards it at speed 
v
/
2
. Because of the symmetry, after the collision both must be moving away from the center of mass at the same speed. Adding the speed of the center of mass to both, we find that the body that was moving is now stopped and the other is moving away at speed v. The bodies have exchanged their velocities. Regardless of the velocities of the bodies, a switch to the center of mass frame leads us to the same conclusion. Therefore, the final velocities are given by[4]

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}v_{1}&=u_{2}\\v_{2}&=u_{1}\,.\end{aligned}}} {\begin{aligned}v_{1}&=u_{2}\\v_{2}&=u_{1}\,.\end{aligned}}
In general, when the initial velocities are known, the final velocities are given by[9]

{\displaystyle v_{1}=\left({\frac {m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}\right)u_{1}+\left({\frac {2m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}\right)u_{2}\,} v_{1}=\left({\frac {m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}\right)u_{1}+\left({\frac {2m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}\right)u_{2}\,
{\displaystyle v_{2}=\left({\frac {m_{2}-m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}\right)u_{2}+\left({\frac {2m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}\right)u_{1}\,.} v_{2}=\left({\frac {m_{2}-m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}\right)u_{2}+\left({\frac {2m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}\right)u_{1}\,.
If one body has much greater mass than the other, its velocity will be little affected by a collision while the other body will experience a large change.

Inelastic collisions
Main article: Inelastic collision

a perfectly inelastic collision between equal masses
In an inelastic collision, some of the kinetic energy of the colliding bodies is converted into other forms of energy (such as heat or sound). Examples include traffic collisions,[10] in which the effect of loss of kinetic energy can be seen in the damage to the vehicles; electrons losing some of their energy to atoms (as in the Franck–Hertz experiment);[11] and particle accelerators in which the kinetic energy is converted into mass in the form of new particles.

In a perfectly inelastic collision (such as a bug hitting a windshield), both bodies have the same motion afterwards. If one body is motionless to begin with, the equation for conservation of momentum is

{\displaystyle m_{1}u_{1}=\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)v\,,} m_{1}u_{1}=\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)v\,,
so

{\displaystyle v={\frac {m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}u_{1}\,.} v={\frac {m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}u_{1}\,.
In a frame of reference moving at the speed v), the objects are brought to rest by the collision and 100% of the kinetic energy is converted to other forms of energy.

One measure of the inelasticity of the collision is the coefficient of restitution CR, defined as the ratio of relative velocity of separation to relative velocity of approach. In applying this measure to a ball bouncing from a solid surface, this can be easily measured using the following formula:[12]

{\displaystyle C_{\text{R}}={\sqrt {\frac {\text{bounce height}}{\text{drop height}}}}\,.} C_{\text{R}}={\sqrt {\frac {\text{bounce height}}{\text{drop height}}}}\,.
The momentum and energy equations also apply to the motions of objects that begin together and then move apart. For example, an explosion is the result of a chain reaction that transforms potential energy stored in chemical, mechanical, or nuclear form into kinetic energy, acoustic energy, and electromagnetic radiation. Rockets also make use of conservation of momentum: propellant is thrust outward, gaining momentum, and an equal and opposite momentum is imparted to the rocket.[13]

Multiple dimensions

Two-dimensional elastic collision. There is no motion perpendicular to the image, so only two components are needed to represent the velocities and momenta. The two blue vectors represent velocities after the collision and add vectorially to get the initial (red) velocity.
Real motion has both direction and velocity and must be represented by a vector. In a coordinate system with x, y, z axes, velocity has components vx in the x-direction, vy in the y-direction, vz in the z-direction. The vector is represented by a boldface symbol:[14]

{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =\left(v_{x},v_{y},v_{z}\right).} \mathbf {v} =\left(v_{x},v_{y},v_{z}\right).
Similarly, the momentum is a vector quantity and is represented by a boldface symbol:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =\left(p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}\right).} \mathbf {p} =\left(p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}\right).
The equations in the previous sections, work in vector form if the scalars p and v are replaced by vectors p and v. Each vector equation represents three scalar equations. For example,

{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v} } \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v} 
represents three equations:[14]

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p_{x}&=mv_{x}\\p_{y}&=mv_{y}\\p_{z}&=mv_{z}.\end{aligned}}} {\begin{aligned}p_{x}&=mv_{x}\\p_{y}&=mv_{y}\\p_{z}&=mv_{z}.\end{aligned}}
The kinetic energy equations are exceptions to the above replacement rule. The equations are still one-dimensional, but each scalar represents the magnitude of the vector, for example,

{\displaystyle v^{2}=v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_{z}^{2}\,.} v^{2}=v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_{z}^{2}\,.
Each vector equation represents three scalar equations. Often coordinates can be chosen so that only two components are needed, as in the figure. Each component can be obtained separately and the results combined to produce a vector result.[14]

A simple construction involving the center of mass frame can be used to show that if a stationary elastic sphere is struck by a moving sphere, the two will head off at right angles after the collision (as in the figure).[15]

Objects of variable mass
The concept of momentum plays a fundamental role in explaining the behavior of variable-mass objects such as a rocket ejecting fuel or a star accreting gas. In analyzing such an object, one treats the object's mass as a function that varies with time: m(t). The momentum of the object at time t is therefore p(t) = m(t)v(t). One might then try to invoke Newton's second law of motion by saying that the external force F on the object is related to its momentum p(t) by F = 
dp
/
dt
, but this is incorrect, as is the related expression found by applying the product rule to 
d(mv)
/
dt
:[16]

{\displaystyle F=m(t){\frac {dv}{dt}}+v(t){\frac {dm}{dt}}.} {\displaystyle F=m(t){\frac {dv}{dt}}+v(t){\frac {dm}{dt}}.} (incorrect)
This equation does not correctly describe the motion of variable-mass objects. The correct equation is

{\displaystyle F=m(t){\frac {dv}{dt}}-u{\frac {dm}{dt}},} F=m(t){\frac {dv}{dt}}-u{\frac {dm}{dt}},
where u is the velocity of the ejected/accreted mass as seen in the object's rest frame.[16] This is distinct from v, which is the velocity of the object itself as seen in an inertial frame.

This equation is derived by keeping track of both the momentum of the object as well as the momentum of the ejected/accreted mass (dm). When considered together, the object and the mass (dm) constitute a closed system in which total momentum is conserved.

{\displaystyle P(t+dt)=(m-dm)(v+dv)+dm(v-u)=mv+mdv-udm=P(t)+mdv-udm} {\displaystyle P(t+dt)=(m-dm)(v+dv)+dm(v-u)=mv+mdv-udm=P(t)+mdv-udm}
Relativistic
See also: Mass in special relativity and Tests of relativistic energy and momentum
Lorentz invariance
Newtonian physics assumes that absolute time and space exist outside of any observer; this gives rise to Galilean invariance. It also results in a prediction that the speed of light can vary from one reference frame to another. This is contrary to observation. In the special theory of relativity, Einstein keeps the postulate that the equations of motion do not depend on the reference frame, but assumes that the speed of light c is invariant. As a result, position and time in two reference frames are related by the Lorentz transformation instead of the Galilean transformation.[17]

Consider, for example, a reference frame moving relative to another at velocity v in the x direction. The Galilean transformation gives the coordinates of the moving frame as

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}t'&=t\\x'&=x-vt\end{aligned}}} {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}t'&=t\\x'&=x-vt\end{aligned}}}
while the Lorentz transformation gives[18]

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}t'&=\gamma \left(t-{\frac {vx}{c^{2}}}\right)\\x'&=\gamma \left(x-vt\right)\,\end{aligned}}} {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}t'&=\gamma \left(t-{\frac {vx}{c^{2}}}\right)\\x'&=\gamma \left(x-vt\right)\,\end{aligned}}}
where ? is the Lorentz factor:

{\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}.} {\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}.}
Newton's second law, with mass fixed, is not invariant under a Lorentz transformation. However, it can be made invariant by making the inertial mass m of an object a function of velocity:

{\displaystyle m=\gamma m_{0}\,;} m=\gamma m_{0}\,;
m0 is the object's invariant mass.[19]

The modified momentum,

{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =\gamma m_{0}\mathbf {v} \,,} \mathbf {p} =\gamma m_{0}\mathbf {v} \,,
obeys Newton's second law:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac {d\mathbf {p} }{dt}}\,.} \mathbf {F} ={\frac {d\mathbf {p} }{dt}}\,.
Within the domain of classical mechanics, relativistic momentum closely approximates Newtonian momentum: at low velocity, ?m0v is approximately equal to m0v, the Newtonian expression for momentum.

Four-vector formulation
Main article: Four-momentum
In the theory of special relativity, physical quantities are expressed in terms of four-vectors that include time as a fourth coordinate along with the three space coordinates. These vectors are generally represented by capital letters, for example R for position. The expression for the four-momentum depends on how the coordinates are expressed. Time may be given in its normal units or multiplied by the speed of light so that all the components of the four-vector have dimensions of length. If the latter scaling is used, an interval of proper time, ?, defined by[20]

{\displaystyle c^{2}d\tau ^{2}=c^{2}dt^{2}-dx^{2}-dy^{2}-dz^{2}\,,} c^{2}d\tau ^{2}=c^{2}dt^{2}-dx^{2}-dy^{2}-dz^{2}\,,
is invariant under Lorentz transformations (in this expression and in what follows the (+ ? ? ?) metric signature has been used, different authors use different conventions). Mathematically this invariance can be ensured in one of two ways: by treating the four-vectors as Euclidean vectors and multiplying time by v?1; or by keeping time a real quantity and embedding the vectors in a Minkowski space.[21] In a Minkowski space, the scalar product of two four-vectors U = (U0,U1,U2,U3) and V = (V0,V1,V2,V3) is defined as

{\displaystyle \mathbf {U} \cdot \mathbf {V} =U_{0}V_{0}-U_{1}V_{1}-U_{2}V_{2}-U_{3}V_{3}\,.} \mathbf {U} \cdot \mathbf {V} =U_{0}V_{0}-U_{1}V_{1}-U_{2}V_{2}-U_{3}V_{3}\,.
In all the coordinate systems, the (contravariant) relativistic four-velocity is defined by

{\displaystyle \mathbf {U} \equiv {\frac {d\mathbf {R} }{d\tau }}=\gamma {\frac {d\mathbf {R} }{dt}}\,,} \mathbf {U} \equiv {\frac {d\mathbf {R} }{d\tau }}=\gamma {\frac {d\mathbf {R} }{dt}}\,,
and the (contravariant) four-momentum is

{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =m_{0}\mathbf {U} \,,} \mathbf {P} =m_{0}\mathbf {U} \,,
where m0 is the invariant mass. If R = (ct,x,y,z) (in Minkowski space), then

{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =\gamma m_{0}\left(c,\mathbf {v} \right)=(mc,\mathbf {p} )\,.} \mathbf {P} =\gamma m_{0}\left(c,\mathbf {v} \right)=(mc,\mathbf {p} )\,.
Using Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, E = mc2, this can be rewritten as

{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =\left({\frac {E}{c}},\mathbf {p} \right)\,.} \mathbf {P} =\left({\frac {E}{c}},\mathbf {p} \right)\,.
Thus, conservation of four-momentum is Lorentz-invariant and implies conservation of both mass and energy.

The magnitude of the momentum four-vector is equal to m0c:

{\displaystyle ||\mathbf {P} ||^{2}=\mathbf {P} \cdot \mathbf {P} =\gamma ^{2}m_{0}^{2}(c^{2}-v^{2})=(m_{0}c)^{2}\,,} ||\mathbf {P} ||^{2}=\mathbf {P} \cdot \mathbf {P} =\gamma ^{2}m_{0}^{2}(c^{2}-v^{2})=(m_{0}c)^{2}\,,
and is invariant across all reference frames.

The relativistic energy–momentum relationship holds even for massless particles such as photons; by setting m0 = 0 it follows that

{\displaystyle E=pc\,.} E=pc\,.
In a game of relativistic "billiards", if a stationary particle is hit by a moving particle in an elastic collision, the paths formed by the two afterwards will form an acute angle. This is unlike the non-relativistic case where they travel at right angles.[22]

The four-momentum of a planar wave can be related to a wave four-vector[23]

{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =\left({\frac {E}{c}},{\vec {\mathbf {p} }}\right)=\hbar \mathbf {K} =\hbar \left({\frac {\omega }{c}},{\vec {\mathbf {k} }}\right)} {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =\left({\frac {E}{c}},{\vec {\mathbf {p} }}\right)=\hbar \mathbf {K} =\hbar \left({\frac {\omega }{c}},{\vec {\mathbf {k} }}\right)}
For a particle, the relationship between temporal components, E = h ?, is the Planck–Einstein relation, and the relation between spatial components, p= h k, describes a de Broglie matter wave.

Generalized
See also: Analytical mechanics
Newton's laws can be difficult to apply to many kinds of motion because the motion is limited by constraints. For example, a bead on an abacus is constrained to move along its wire and a pendulum bob is constrained to swing at a fixed distance from the pivot. Many such constraints can be incorporated by changing the normal Cartesian coordinates to a set of generalized coordinates that may be fewer in number.[24] Refined mathematical methods have been developed for solving mechanics problems in generalized coordinates. They introduce a generalized momentum, also known as the canonical or conjugate momentum, that extends the concepts of both linear momentum and angular momentum. To distinguish it from generalized momentum, the product of mass and velocity is also referred to as mechanical, kinetic or kinematic momentum.[6][25][26] The two main methods are described below.

Lagrangian mechanics
In Lagrangian mechanics, a Lagrangian is defined as the difference between the kinetic energy T and the potential energy V:

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}=T-V\,.} {\mathcal {L}}=T-V\,.
If the generalized coordinates are represented as a vector q = (q1, q2, ... , qN) and time differentiation is represented by a dot over the variable, then the equations of motion (known as the Lagrange or Euler–Lagrange equations) are a set of N equations:[27]

{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\left({\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{j}}}\right)-{\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial q_{j}}}=0\,.} {\frac {d}{dt}}\left({\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{j}}}\right)-{\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial q_{j}}}=0\,.
If a coordinate qi is not a Cartesian coordinate, the associated generalized momentum component pi does not necessarily have the dimensions of linear momentum. Even if qi is a Cartesian coordinate, pi will not be the same as the mechanical momentum if the potential depends on velocity.[6] Some sources represent the kinematic momentum by the symbol ?.[28]

In this mathematical framework, a generalized momentum is associated with the generalized coordinates. Its components are defined as

{\displaystyle p_{j}={\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{j}}}\,.} p_{j}={\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{j}}}\,.
Each component pj is said to be the conjugate momentum for the coordinate qj.

Now if a given coordinate qi does not appear in the Lagrangian (although its time derivative might appear), then

{\displaystyle p_{j}={\text{constant}}\,.} p_{j}={\text{constant}}\,.
This is the generalization of the conservation of momentum.[6]

Even if the generalized coordinates are just the ordinary spatial coordinates, the conjugate momenta are not necessarily the ordinary momentum coordinates. An example is found in the section on electromagnetism.

Hamiltonian mechanics
In Hamiltonian mechanics, the Lagrangian (a function of generalized coordinates and their derivatives) is replaced by a Hamiltonian that is a function of generalized coordinates and momentum. The Hamiltonian is defined as

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}\left(\mathbf {q} ,\mathbf {p} ,t\right)=\mathbf {p} \cdot {\dot {\mathbf {q} }}-{\mathcal {L}}\left(\mathbf {q} ,{\dot {\mathbf {q} }},t\right)\,,} {\mathcal {H}}\left(\mathbf {q} ,\mathbf {p} ,t\right)=\mathbf {p} \cdot {\dot {\mathbf {q} }}-{\mathcal {L}}\left(\mathbf {q} ,{\dot {\mathbf {q} }},t\right)\,,
where the momentum is obtained by differentiating the Lagrangian as above. The Hamiltonian equations of motion are[29]

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\dot {q}}_{i}&={\frac {\partial {\mathcal {H}}}{\partial p_{i}}}\\-{\dot {p}}_{i}&={\frac {\partial {\mathcal {H}}}{\partial q_{i}}}\\-{\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial t}}&={\frac {d{\mathcal {H}}}{dt}}\,.\end{aligned}}} {\begin{aligned}{\dot {q}}_{i}&={\frac {\partial {\mathcal {H}}}{\partial p_{i}}}\\-{\dot {p}}_{i}&={\frac {\partial {\mathcal {H}}}{\partial q_{i}}}\\-{\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial t}}&={\frac {d{\mathcal {H}}}{dt}}\,.\end{aligned}}
As in Lagrangian mechanics, if a generalized coordinate does not appear in the Hamiltonian, its conjugate momentum component is conserved.[30]

Symmetry and conservation
Conservation of momentum is a mathematical consequence of the homogeneity (shift symmetry) of space (position in space is the canonical conjugate quantity to momentum). That is, conservation of momentum is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not depend on position; this is a special case of Noether's theorem.[31]

Electromagnetic
Particle in a field
In Maxwell's equations, the forces between particles are mediated by electric and magnetic fields. The electromagnetic force (Lorentz force) on a particle with charge q due to a combination of electric field E and magnetic field B is

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =q(\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} ).} \mathbf {F} =q(\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} ).
(in SI units).[32]:2 It has an electric potential ?(r, t) and magnetic vector potential A(r, t).[28] In the non-relativistic regime, its generalized momentum is

{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =m\mathbf {\mathbf {v} } +q\mathbf {A} ,} {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =m\mathbf {\mathbf {v} } +q\mathbf {A} ,}
while in relativistic mechanics this becomes

{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =\gamma m\mathbf {\mathbf {v} } +q\mathbf {A} .} {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =\gamma m\mathbf {\mathbf {v} } +q\mathbf {A} .}
Conservation
In Newtonian mechanics, the law of conservation of momentum can be derived from the law of action and reaction, which states that every force has a reciprocating equal and opposite force. Under some circumstances, moving charged particles can exert forces on each other in non-opposite directions.[33] Nevertheless, the combined momentum of the particles and the electromagnetic field is conserved.

Vacuum
The Lorentz force imparts a momentum to the particle, so by Newton's second law the particle must impart a momentum to the electromagnetic fields.[34]

In a vacuum, the momentum per unit volume is

{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} ={\frac {1}{\mu _{0}c^{2}}}\mathbf {E} \times \mathbf {B} \,,} \mathbf {g} ={\frac {1}{\mu _{0}c^{2}}}\mathbf {E} \times \mathbf {B} \,,
where ?0 is the vacuum permeability and c is the speed of light. The momentum density is proportional to the Poynting vector S which gives the directional rate of energy transfer per unit area:[34][35]

{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} ={\frac {\mathbf {S} }{c^{2}}}\,.} \mathbf {g} ={\frac {\mathbf {S} }{c^{2}}}\,.
If momentum is to be conserved over the volume V over a region Q, changes in the momentum of matter through the Lorentz force must be balanced by changes in the momentum of the electromagnetic field and outflow of momentum. If Pmech is the momentum of all the particles in Q, and the particles are treated as a continuum, then Newton's second law gives

{\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {P} _{\text{mech}}}{dt}}=\iiint \limits _{Q}\left(\rho \mathbf {E} +\mathbf {J} \times \mathbf {B} \right)dV\,.} {\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {P} _{\text{mech}}}{dt}}=\iiint \limits _{Q}\left(\rho \mathbf {E} +\mathbf {J} \times \mathbf {B} \right)dV\,.}
The electromagnetic momentum is

{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} _{\text{field}}={\frac {1}{\mu _{0}c^{2}}}\iiint \limits _{Q}\mathbf {E} \times \mathbf {B} \,dV\,,} {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} _{\text{field}}={\frac {1}{\mu _{0}c^{2}}}\iiint \limits _{Q}\mathbf {E} \times \mathbf {B} \,dV\,,}
and the equation for conservation of each component i of the momentum is

{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\left(\mathbf {P} _{\text{mech}}+\mathbf {P} _{\text{field}}\right)_{i}=\iint \limits _{\sigma }\left(\sum \limits _{j}T_{ij}n_{j}\right)d\Sigma \,.} {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\left(\mathbf {P} _{\text{mech}}+\mathbf {P} _{\text{field}}\right)_{i}=\iint \limits _{\sigma }\left(\sum \limits _{j}T_{ij}n_{j}\right)d\Sigma \,.}
The term on the right is an integral over the surface area ? of the surface ? representing momentum flow into and out of the volume, and nj is a component of the surface normal of S. The quantity Tij is called the Maxwell stress tensor, defined as

{\displaystyle T_{ij}\equiv \epsilon _{0}\left(E_{i}E_{j}-{\frac {1}{2}}\delta _{ij}E^{2}\right)+{\frac {1}{\mu _{0}}}\left(B_{i}B_{j}-{\frac {1}{2}}\delta _{ij}B^{2}\right)\,.} T_{ij}\equiv \epsilon _{0}\left(E_{i}E_{j}-{\frac {1}{2}}\delta _{ij}E^{2}\right)+{\frac {1}{\mu _{0}}}\left(B_{i}B_{j}-{\frac {1}{2}}\delta _{ij}B^{2}\right)\,.[34]
Media
The above results are for the microscopic Maxwell equations, applicable to electromagnetic forces in a vacuum (or on a very small scale in media). It is more difficult to define momentum density in media because the division into electromagnetic and mechanical is arbitrary. The definition of electromagnetic momentum density is modified to

{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} ={\frac {1}{c^{2}}}\mathbf {E} \times \mathbf {H} ={\frac {\mathbf {S} }{c^{2}}}\,,} \mathbf {g} ={\frac {1}{c^{2}}}\mathbf {E} \times \mathbf {H} ={\frac {\mathbf {S} }{c^{2}}}\,,
where the H-field H is related to the B-field and the magnetization M by

{\displaystyle \mathbf {B} =\mu _{0}\left(\mathbf {H} +\mathbf {M} \right)\,.} \mathbf {B} =\mu _{0}\left(\mathbf {H} +\mathbf {M} \right)\,.
The electromagnetic stress tensor depends on the properties of the media.[34]

Quantum mechanical
Further information: Momentum operator
In quantum mechanics, momentum is defined as a self-adjoint operator on the wave function. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle defines limits on how accurately the momentum and position of a single observable system can be known at once. In quantum mechanics, position and momentum are conjugate variables.

For a single particle described in the position basis the momentum operator can be written as

{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} ={\hbar \over i}\nabla =-i\hbar \nabla \,,} \mathbf {p} ={\hbar  \over i}\nabla =-i\hbar \nabla \,,
where ? is the gradient operator, h is the reduced Planck constant, and i is the imaginary unit. This is a commonly encountered form of the momentum operator, though the momentum operator in other bases can take other forms. For example, in momentum space the momentum operator is represented as

{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} \psi (p)=p\psi (p)\,,} \mathbf {p} \psi (p)=p\psi (p)\,,
where the operator p acting on a wave function ?(p) yields that wave function multiplied by the value p, in an analogous fashion to the way that the position operator acting on a wave function ?(x) yields that wave function multiplied by the value x.

For both massive and massless objects, relativistic momentum is related to the phase constant {\displaystyle \beta } \beta  by[36]

{\displaystyle p=\hbar \beta } {\displaystyle p=\hbar \beta }
Electromagnetic radiation (including visible light, ultraviolet light, and radio waves) is carried by photons. Even though photons (the particle aspect of light) have no mass, they still carry momentum. This leads to applications such as the solar sail. The calculation of the momentum of light within dielectric media is somewhat controversial (see Abraham–Minkowski controversy).[37][38]

In deformable bodies and fluids
Conservation in a continuum
Main article: Cauchy momentum equation

Motion of a material body
In fields such as fluid dynamics and solid mechanics, it is not feasible to follow the motion of individual atoms or molecules. Instead, the materials must be approximated by a continuum in which there is a particle or fluid parcel at each point that is assigned the average of the properties of atoms in a small region nearby. In particular, it has a density ? and velocity v that depend on time t and position r. The momentum per unit volume is ?v.[39]

Consider a column of water in hydrostatic equilibrium. All the forces on the water are in balance and the water is motionless. On any given drop of water, two forces are balanced. The first is gravity, which acts directly on each atom and molecule inside. The gravitational force per unit volume is ?g, where g is the gravitational acceleration. The second force is the sum of all the forces exerted on its surface by the surrounding water. The force from below is greater than the force from above by just the amount needed to balance gravity. The normal force per unit area is the pressure p. The average force per unit volume inside the droplet is the gradient of the pressure, so the force balance equation is[40]

{\displaystyle -\nabla p+\rho \mathbf {g} =0\,.} -\nabla p+\rho \mathbf {g} =0\,.
If the forces are not balanced, the droplet accelerates. This acceleration is not simply the partial derivative 
?v
/
?t
 because the fluid in a given volume changes with time. Instead, the material derivative is needed:[41]

{\displaystyle {\frac {D}{Dt}}\equiv {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}+\mathbf {v} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\,.} {\frac {D}{Dt}}\equiv {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}+\mathbf {v} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\,.
Applied to any physical quantity, the material derivative includes the rate of change at a point and the changes due to advection as fluid is carried past the point. Per unit volume, the rate of change in momentum is equal to ?
Dv
/
Dt
. This is equal to the net force on the droplet.

Forces that can change the momentum of a droplet include the gradient of the pressure and gravity, as above. In addition, surface forces can deform the droplet. In the simplest case, a shear stress ?, exerted by a force parallel to the surface of the droplet, is proportional to the rate of deformation or strain rate. Such a shear stress occurs if the fluid has a velocity gradient because the fluid is moving faster on one side than another. If the speed in the x direction varies with z, the tangential force in direction x per unit area normal to the z direction is

{\displaystyle \sigma _{\text{zx}}=-\mu {\frac {\partial v_{x}}{\partial z}}\,,} {\displaystyle \sigma _{\text{zx}}=-\mu {\frac {\partial v_{x}}{\partial z}}\,,}
where ? is the viscosity. This is also a flux, or flow per unit area, of x-momentum through the surface.[42]

Including the effect of viscosity, the momentum balance equations for the incompressible flow of a Newtonian fluid are

{\displaystyle \rho {\frac {D\mathbf {v} }{Dt}}=-{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}p+\mu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {v} +\rho \mathbf {g} .\,} \rho {\frac {D\mathbf {v} }{Dt}}=-{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}p+\mu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {v} +\rho \mathbf {g} .\,
These are known as the Navier–Stokes equations.[43]

The momentum balance equations can be extended to more general materials, including solids. For each surface with normal in direction i and force in direction j, there is a stress component ?ij. The nine components make up the Cauchy stress tensor ?, which includes both pressure and shear. The local conservation of momentum is expressed by the Cauchy momentum equation:

{\displaystyle \rho {\frac {D\mathbf {v} }{Dt}}={\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}+\mathbf {f} \,,} \rho {\frac {D\mathbf {v} }{Dt}}={\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}+\mathbf {f} \,,
where f is the body force.[44]

The Cauchy momentum equation is broadly applicable to deformations of solids and liquids. The relationship between the stresses and the strain rate depends on the properties of the material (see Types of viscosity).

Acoustic waves
A disturbance in a medium gives rise to oscillations, or waves, that propagate away from their source. In a fluid, small changes in pressure p can often be described by the acoustic wave equation:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{2}p}{\partial t^{2}}}=c^{2}\nabla ^{2}p\,,} {\frac {\partial ^{2}p}{\partial t^{2}}}=c^{2}\nabla ^{2}p\,,
where c is the speed of sound. In a solid, similar equations can be obtained for propagation of pressure (P-waves) and shear (S-waves).[45]

The flux, or transport per unit area, of a momentum component ?vj by a velocity vi is equal to ? vjvj. In the linear approximation that leads to the above acoustic equation, the time average of this flux is zero. However, nonlinear effects can give rise to a nonzero average.[46] It is possible for momentum flux to occur even though the wave itself does not have a mean momentum.[47]
